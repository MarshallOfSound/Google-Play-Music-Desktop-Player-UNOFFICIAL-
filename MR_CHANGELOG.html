This is a patch release of Google Play Music Desktop Player<br />

YouTube Music Support<br />
<p>You can now listen to YouTube Music by choosing the "YouTube Music" option in the tray menu.</p>
<p>Please note that support for YouTube Music is in it's early stages, the core functionality works but things like Theming and the Mini Player do not yet work.</p>

Here is a quick run down of all things that have changed.
