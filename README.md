Run "Google Play Music" as a standalone desktop app.  Never again will you have to hunt through your tabs to pause your music, or stop listening to your favourite song because Chrome is guzzling up all your RAM..

Integrating with GPMDP from External Applications
-------------------------------------------------
There are two methods you can use to integrate with GPMDP from an external application.  
1. [JSON Interface](docs/PlaybackAPI.md)  
2. [Web Socket Interface](docs/PlaybackAPI_WebSocket.md)  

Both are documented in the [Docs](docs) folder.  For one time read access you should
probably use the `JSON` interface.  For an application that requires continuous
updates as to the state of GPMDP or needs to control GPMDP you should use the
`Web Socket` interface.

Issues
-------
If you have any bugs / issues please check the
[FAQ](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/wiki/FAQ)
first before raising an issue

Development
-----------

To get started just pull the repo and run the following

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

To build the installers / release packages you need to run, you can only build a platforms installer from that platform.
```bash
# Windows
npm run make:win

# Mac OS X
npm run make:darwin

# Ubuntu (Requires the 'dpkg' package)
npm run make:deb

# Fedora (Requires the 'rpm' package)
npm run make:rpm
```

All releases will be signing with my Code Signing Certificates (Authenticode on Windows and Codesign on OS X)

Please see the [development FAQ](https://github.com/MarshallOfSound/Google-Play-Music-Desktop-Player-UNOFFICIAL-/wiki/Development-FAQ) for additional requirements for building.
