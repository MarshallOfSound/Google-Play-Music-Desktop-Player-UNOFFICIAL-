# Playback Information API

Google Play Music Desktop Player provides an interface for external
applications to determine the currently played song and playback status.

The interface is provided through a file that is continuously updated,
allowing external applications to watch the file to always have the
current playback information. The file is JSON-formatted and located at
`%APPDATA%\GPMDP_STORE\playback.json` on Windows or at `~/GPMDP_STORE/playback.json` on Linux.

## Data Format

The file contains a single JSON object with the following attributes:
- **playing**: (bool) Whether or not the player is current playing.  This is false when the player is closed.
- **song**: (object) A song object in the format below.
- **time**: (object) A time object in the format below.
- **songLyrics**: (string) The full lyrics of the current song, or null if we could not find the lyrics

##### Song Object
All attributes are `null` if no song is playing.  If a song is paused the variables are set correctly.
- **title**: (string)  Title of the song
- **artist**: (string) Artist of the song
- **album**: (string) Album of the song
- **albumArt**: (string) URL that points the Album Art

#### Time Object
All attributes are `0` of no song is playing.  If a song is paused the variables are set correctly.
- **current**: (number) Number of milliseconds into the song we are
- **total**: (number) Total length of the song in milliseconds
